The app prototype focused on creating a centralized platform where students could connect, share opportunities, and build meaningful relationships within their academic community.<br>
          <b>Key Features:</b> The prototype included event posting and discovery, job and internship listings, community chat rooms, and user profiles. Each feature was designed with the specific needs of graduate students in mind, considering their busy schedules and desire for professional networking opportunities.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The project successfully demonstrated how mobile technology could be leveraged to strengthen academic communities. User testing showed that students were particularly interested in the job listings and event features, indicating a strong need for these types of community-building tools in graduate education.</div>
