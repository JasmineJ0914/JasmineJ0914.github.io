By creating a prototype that resembled a traditional restaurant table setting, we aimed to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world cultural experiences.<br>
          <b>Design Concept:</b> The prototype featured a table with embedded multimedia elements, including audio stories, visual content, and interactive elements that would guide users through various aspects of Chinatown's history and culture. The design was inspired by the communal nature of dining in Chinese culture, where stories are often shared over meals.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The project successfully demonstrated how physical design and digital technology could be combined to create meaningful cultural learning experiences. Students who interacted with the prototype reported feeling more connected to the community and expressed interest in visiting Chinatown to experience the culture firsthand.</div>
