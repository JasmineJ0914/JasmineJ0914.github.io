          <div class="body-text">The 2025 FIELD School Sponsorship Packet was designed to support the National FIELD School's mission of building resilient farming communities and empowering new farmers. This comprehensive packet needed to effectively communicate the conference's value proposition while providing clear sponsorship opportunities and benefits.<br>
          <b>Design Challenge:</b> Create a professional, engaging sponsorship packet that would attract sponsors ranging from $500 to $5,000 while clearly communicating the conference's impact on sustainable agriculture and beginning farmer training programs.</div>
          <div class="body-text"><b>Key Design Elements:</b> The packet features a clean, modern layout with strategic use of color (green, gold, and red) to reflect agricultural themes. Data visualizations effectively communicate the conference's reach and impact, including statistics about participating organizations (62 organizations) and attendees (107 from beginning farm organizations nationwide). The design emphasizes the conference's 14-year history and its role in supporting over 5,000 farmers collectively.</div>
          <div class="body-text"><b>Content Strategy:</b> The packet includes multiple sections: conference overview, mission & values, sponsorship opportunities with tiered benefits, terms & conditions, and a comprehensive sponsorship form. Each section is designed to build trust and demonstrate the conference's professional organization and significant impact on the sustainable farming community.</div>
          <div class="body-text"><b>Project Impact:</b> The sponsorship packet content is now live on the <a href="https://nesfp.nutrition.tufts.edu/national-field-network/field-school" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Entry Sustainable Farming Project website</a>, where it serves as the official sponsorship information for the 2025 National FIELD School conference. The design successfully communicates the conference's value proposition and has been integrated into their digital presence to attract sponsors and support the sustainable farming community.</div>
